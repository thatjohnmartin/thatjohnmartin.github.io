            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>The rate of adoption and the volume of chatter about ad blockers continues to increase. So far, the effect on the publishing and advertising industries is probably overstated but it is meaningful. It's not yet clear (to me, at least) that ad blockers will become so prevalent that they will make traditional (i.e. non-social, non-native) digital advertising untenable, but it's certainly possible, perhaps likely. If they do, how does it play out? What happens to ad-supported publishers? I don't know, but it's interesting to think about.</p>
<h2>The Winners</h2>
<p>The big social and native properties should be largely unaffected. This includes, among others, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Hulu, and BuzzFeed. Many of these companies will be hurt — Facebook's Atlas ambitions will be thwarted, non-app YouTube will become a big loss leader, etc — but it won't be fatal. In fact, given a new relative scarcity of inventory, ad rates should rise and may well exceed any losses.</p>
<p>Additionally, ad-supported app developers and publishers that make use of certain types of native ad formats will not only be unharmed but will probably benefit, given the new scarcity previously mentioned.</p>
<h2>The Losers</h2>
<p>All other ad-supported publishers are probably fucked.</p>
<p>(By "all other ad-supported publishers" I mean traditional digital ad-supported publishers by which I mean, again, those publishers supported by non-social non-native ads. This includes anything that looks like a banner or a skyscraper or a 300x300 on desktop or mobile, any web-based VAST/VPAID/VWHATEVER video, almost anything that is an IAB standard, and almost anything that has been purchased via RTB and/or with the help of a cookie.)</p>
<p>This will include all publishers, from the big premiums all the way down to the little long-tails.</p>
<h2>Giving Up — Alternative Revenue Streams</h2>
<p>In this post-traditional-digital-ad world, some publishers are likely to get re-energized about subscription-based business models. This will work great for some (and okay, I guess, for others) but it's not going to save the web-as-we-know-it.</p>
<p>It's early days, but another option is paid content syndication. Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News, and Snapchat Discover render syndicated content in-app (beyond the reach of ad blockers) and split ad revenue with publishers.</p>
<p>These are both valid paths, but come with significant tradeoffs. In the case of subscription revenue, if it's possible at all, it means an order of magnitude (it not several) reduction in audience size, and, hence, impact. In the case of content syndication, it means giving up independence and identity.</p>
<h2>Fighting Back</h2>
<p>Given the immense inertia of the entire advertising apparatus — brands, agencies, budgets, etc — it seems much more likely that something <em>advertising-like</em> will emerge. But what would that look like? What kind of <em>advertising-like</em> thing could exist under this new ad blocker regime?</p>
<p>I think that thing would have to take one of two approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outsmart the ad blockers</li>
<li>Negotiate with the ad blockers</li>
</ol>
<p>Native advertising can be seen as an attempt to outsmart the ad blockers. The particular strains of native advertising that we're interested in here are those that exist on the web. This is a motley and growing set of formats: blog posts thanking sponsors, sponsor-written posts (both good and gross), sponsored content, promoted results, to name a few. If ad blockers can't distinguish advertising from content then they can't block it.</p>
<p>As with subscriptions, native advertising will work well for many publishers. However, the more prevalent this becomes, the more likely we are to see an arms race between native advertisers and ad blockers. And given that, in this potential future, ad blockers are already installed and accepted by users, you'd have to bet on the ad blockers as theirs is the easier task.</p>
<p>There are already negotations of a sort between particular publishers/networks and ad blockers. That sort would be extortion. Large publishers such as Google and Taboola pay to be whitelisted. This is obviously not scalable. And just gross, jeez.</p>
<p>A deal that doesn't feature extortion money would have to be based on a commitment to well-behaved, user-friendly ads. No doubt this how AdChoices sees itself but through the eyes of the modern day user (and by extension the modern day ad blocker) AdChoices doesn't go nearly far enough.</p>
<p>To get a feel for whether this is at all realistic, let's imagine the most extreme example of a well-behaved ad format that still performs the basic job of advertising, that is, exposing a message or an image to a consumer.</p>
<p>Our most-reasonable-ad-format-imaginable would feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more than a single ad per page</li>
<li>No user-level targeting</li>
<li>No tracking of any type, including cookies, pixels, or equivalents</li>
<li>No popping out or breaking out of the bounds of the basic ad unit</li>
<li>No autoplay animation or video</li>
<li>Clearly labeled as advertising</li>
<li>No redirects on load</li>
<li>No redirects on click</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: simple, static image/text-based ads, targeted only using context, and served up without redirect, one-per-page.</p>
<p>There are plenty of obvious benefits: fast page loads, airy designs, no privacy concerns. It's also very likely that the eCPM per ad unit would increase (due mainly to a newly constrained supply) and somewhat likely that the advertiser performance per impression would increase (due mainly to an improved user experience).</p>
<p>Would this be enough to move the ad blockers to whitelist the format? I don't see why. Even if users prefer this new format they, by and large, are not going to take the time to understand what it is at the most basic level let alone get sufficiently informed and excited about it as to mobilize and demand action.</p>
<p>We can't outsmart them, and we can't negotiate with them. It's pretty bloody dire.</p>
<h2>Nuclear Options</h2>
<p>The IAB has begun to strategize. One option is legal action against the blockers. I have no idea of the legal merits of such a case, but enforcement seems like an impossible and thankless task. Users are not going to be thrilled when you neuter the ad blocker they installed and will at best be hate-viewing the ads they see.</p>
<p>Another option is collective action by publishers whereby ad blocker detectors are used to serve content only to those users who are not blocking ads. Theoretically, this is a powerful weapon. Practically, it is difficult to imagine a large number of publishers acting in a synchronized way with a unified messages that does anything other than irritate users.</p>
<p>Again, it's dire.</p>
<h2>My Prediction</h2>
<p>I suspect that while ad blockers will continue to gain share we won't see a singular moment of victory such as we did in the early days of the web with popup blockers. Nevertheless, a substantial subset of users, if not a majority, will eventually get on board. This will simply accelerate the shift of dollars that is already well under way from traditional digital advertising to social and native (for reasons other than ad blockers).</p>
<p>This will make life difficult, if not impossible, for many publishers. Those that survive will do so with some combination of the strategies listed above: native advertising, paid content syndication, and subscriptions. Unjustly, there will be publishers of great content that find themselves unsuitable for native advertising, and publishers of total shit for which it's perfect.</p>
<p>Finally, ad tech built on top of IAB standard units, particularly those delivered via RTB and targeted via cookie, will be increasingly marginalized.</p>
