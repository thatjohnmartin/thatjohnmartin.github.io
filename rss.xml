&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From budget allocation to optimization, from data driven insight to creative development; choices and sources are abundant. There is no single source anything but instead a screaming demand for channel (and vendor) specific creative assets for delivery and discovery together with intra and inter channel allocation, optimization and attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that creative assets made for TV don't work as well on Hulu, worse on YouTube and sometimes not at all on Facebook. Assets created for Facebook don't necessarily deliver on Instagram or Pinterest, and Vine is from Mars and SnapChat from Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for media, every platform will claim ROI that is sometimes hard to fathom. 3X from you, and you and you too? It may be true that the auction levels the negotiation playing field but allocation among channels and attribution across them never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't really an important point in the context of the article, but I loved Ben Thompson's distillation of the most extreme bear case for Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, my most extreme Facebook bear case is that the service is the equivalent of an email address: something nearly everyone has because you can’t function without it, even if it’s not their preferred means of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I love it when a writer drags a not-fully-formed thought into crisp reality. Or at least convinces you that that's what happened.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 17:49:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2015-04-22:2015/04/22/facebook-and-the-feed</guid></item><item><title>Do You Have to Love What You Do?</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2015/01/23/do-you-have-to-love-what-you-do</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Fried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with loving what you do, of course – I just don’t think it’s a prerequisite
for starting a business or building a fulfilling career, let alone doing great work. In fact, I
think it’s disingenuous for really successful people to put so much of the focus on love, just as
it’s disingenuous for really rich people to say money doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is a genre: disingenuous things that really X people say about the importance of X
(or thing related to X).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2015 19:37:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2015-01-23:2015/01/23/do-you-have-to-love-what-you-do</guid><category>philosophy</category></item><item><title>Alex Honnold on Living on El Capitan</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2015/01/12/alex-honnold-on-living-on-el-capitan</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold, in a Q&amp;amp;A with Men's Journal about the Dawn Wall climb that Tommy Caldwell and Kevin
Jorgeson are close to sending, on what's it's like to live on wall for many days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on [El Capitan] for four or five days trying to free routes but I've never been on the
wall for two weeks. That's kind of like a different level. What people maybe don't appreciate is
how hard it is to be living on a wall. I mean they haven't walked in two weeks. They've just been
laying and standing and pulling really, really hard on small holds. So the fact that they've had
to recover and stay well-fed and hydrated and take care of their bodies while just like laying in
a cot. Imagine getting out of your hospital bed and doing like the hardest rock climbing that's
ever been done and then getting back on your hospital bed. Like, 'oh, now it's time to recover.'
It's not like taking a shower and stretching and taking a stroll for a little a bit. It's hard
living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org"&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on free will and moral responsiblity. If you have even an ounce of
philosophy in your bones, I can't recommend this highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the lads all reject the concept of libertarian free will, but have various
disagreements on the implications of this, at least in terms of moral responsibility and
blameworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've finished listening to the episode, go and read &lt;a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/sam-harris-vs-bad-wizards-free-will/"&gt;Daniel Miessler's response&lt;/a&gt;. His
reaction was very similar to mine. In particular, he was frustrated that they seemed to have lost
sight of what appeared to be the krux of the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we as individuals, or as a society, accept that free will does not exist, what justification
remains for moral responsibility outside of a consequentialist framework?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since listening to the discussion, I've become more sympathetic to the positions of David and Tamler
(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peez"&gt;David Pizarro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tamler"&gt;Tamler Sommers&lt;/a&gt;, that is, the wizards), but I still take Sam's
position. I think the part of Tamler's alternative that frustrates me is that the point at which one
draws the line between morally responsible (or blameworthy) and not seems to move based not on
whether an individual accepts that an action was causally determined, but on whether an individual
feels the emotional and intellectual weight of that fact. It bugs me that the position of that line
will change over time (as people increasingly feel the weight of determinism) and also that there is
bound to be some situations, perhaps even the drunk driving situation hypothesized in the
discussion, for which some people will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; feel the weight. This distinction feels too squishy
to hang a moral framework on. (But perhaps good moral philosophy is bound to feel squishy. We are,
after all, meat roombas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that I'm not at all sure that Tamler would agree that that's where he draws the line. That's
simply my understanding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when you're done with Daniel's response, go and read &lt;a href="http://bpritchett.blogspot.kr/2015/01/free-will-and-moral-theory-on-sam.html"&gt;Billie Pritchett's summary&lt;/a&gt;. It's
incisive and clarifying and provides a rich philosophical backdrop to the discussion. He pegs Sam as
a &lt;em&gt;global consequentialist&lt;/em&gt;, Tamler as a &lt;em&gt;virtue ethicists of sentiments&lt;/em&gt;, and David as a
&lt;em&gt;deontologist&lt;/em&gt;. I'd love to hear whether or not they agree with these labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in that summary is a lovely little diversion on global consequentialism and the recusive moral
computations it entails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris doesn't say this on the podcast, but he's a consequentialist of a particular type, a global
consequentialist. A global consequentialist is someone who believes that when judging the
consequences of human well-being, we have to take everything into account. This would include
taking judgments into account now and judgments as they would be at some optimal state of the
species. Whatever could contribute to well-being, even perhaps the consequences of accepting the
things that we think would contribute to well-being into well-being, ought to be considered, and
when we do, we will actually improve well-being. Notice the odd but cool (?) recursive quality to
the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you should listen to the &lt;a href="http://verybadwizards.com/episodes/60"&gt;followup episode of the podcast&lt;/a&gt;, the first half is a
continuation of this discussion, the second half is typical VBW goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And jeez, just go and &lt;a href="http://verybadwizards.com/subscribe/"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;, you bum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I've linked to this episode and the posts mentioned above on Twitter a few times already.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnm/status/546002188724486144"&gt;One of those tweets&lt;/a&gt; included a quote from the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ok, but the bridge of "fuck it" doesn't really seem like a philosophically deep argument'
@SamHarrisOrg on latest @verybadwizards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was said by Sam in response to a throw-away line by a temporarily exasperated Tamler. On the
followup episode Tamler complained about the legion of Twitter brats that threw this line back at
him (presumably as evidence of a hollow argument). To assuage my guilt I just want to say that I
quoted it merely because I thought it was a funny line from the show, not to make a any sort of
philosophical point. Philosophy full of f-bombs is my jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 08:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2015-01-08:2015/01/08/re-very-bad-wizards-59-tumors-all-the-way-down</guid><category>philosophy</category></item><item><title>Peacetime PM / Wartime PM</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2015/01/08/peacetime-pm-wartime-pm</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A corollary for product managers to Ben Horowitz’s &lt;a href="ceo"&gt;Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

has two things to say about ad tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, on the likelihood of Google changing their privacy policy to allow a more robust defence
against Facebook's new Atlas data/tech sandwich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take time for Atlas to grow into meaningful market share, but advertisers love high
quality personalization, and that’s what Facebook offers. Google’s in a difficult position here 
– its privacy position was crafted for a world where there was no meaningful competition in web
advertising. Now there is. The phrase to watch is this one: &lt;em&gt;"We will not combine DoubleClick
cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, on his generally positive outlook on ad tech as a sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adtech, a sector that took a beating this past year, will once again be seen as a strong,
investable market. The sector has matured, and is no longer dominated by one-note business models
dependent on a culture of fraud. This trend has already begun to play out with acquisitions in
2014 – LiveRamp, Datalogix, Blue Kai come to mind. With major players like Oracle, Salesforce,
Facebook, Adobe, SAP, IBM and Google battling it out over marketing automation, it’ll be a very
good year to be a differentiated adtech startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 09:49:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2015-01-05:2015/01/05/john-battelles-predictions-for-2015</guid></item><item><title>Why Interactivity Makes Advertising Less Effective</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/12/30/why-interactivity-makes-advertising-less-effective</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Bob Hoffman, the Ad Contrarian, caustic and on point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What marketers still refuse to comprehend is that, at best, advertising is a minor annoyance.
It is pretty clear that most consumers are willing to go to substantial lengths to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2014 10:53:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-12-30:2014/12/30/why-interactivity-makes-advertising-less-effective</guid><category>advertising</category></item><item><title>Pinterest Opens Up to More Advertisers</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/12/29/pinterest-opens-up-to-more-advertisers</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where the advertising comes in. Introduced to a handful of advertising partners in a
limited test in June, the new ads look much like the other content on Pinterest. Marketers pay to
create a Promoted Pin ad, and target it to certain groups of people based on their location, sex
and the type of topic they have shown interest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 15:29:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-12-29:2014/12/29/pinterest-opens-up-to-more-advertisers</guid><category>advertising</category></item><item><title>Yieldmo: Mobile Ad Experiments of 2014</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/12/29/yieldmo-mobile-ad-experiments-of-2014</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yieldmo summarizes their top 5 mobile ad experiments of 2014. These are all really interesting veins
to mine: intentionality, engagement, viewability, urgency, and user interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intentionality&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly important in mobile. I suspect that the accidental click problem is
much larger than any of us want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I'm really encouraged by is the inclusion of &lt;em&gt;user interruption&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine recapping the day’s tweets on your phone. Suddenly, someone wrenches the device from your
hands and shoves an ad in your face. It sounds awful doesn’t it? It also sounds like a lot of
mobile advertising today. At Yieldmo, we’re constantly experimenting with how to deliver pleasant
ads that keep users on the page and engaged with the content they came for. Worried that this
will harm the ad’s performance? You’d be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think user experience, holistically, is the biggest opportunity in digital advertising, mobile or
otherwise. Furthermore, I suspect that, in the short/medium term, there is more easy ground to be
taken in identifying and avoiding negative user experiences than there is in doubling down on
positive experiences. But these are two sides of the same coin and so any real progress here,
whether towards positive experiences or away from negative ones, is more than welcome. I have a lot
more to say about this topic, but I'll leave that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Yieldmo are my favorite ad tech startup right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 14:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-12-29:2014/12/29/yieldmo-mobile-ad-experiments-of-2014</guid><category>advertising</category></item><item><title>Dr Dobbs is Closing</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/12/28/dr-dobbs-is-closing</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Dr Dobbs, the respected, elder statesman of programming journals, announced that they
were closing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would a well-known site, dearly loved by its readers and coming off a year of record page
views, be sunset by its owner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one word, revenue. Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and
revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side,
our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. While some
of this drop is undoubtedly due to turnover in our sales staff, even if the staff had been
stable and executed perfectly, revenue would be much the same and future prospects would surely
point to upcoming losses. This is because in the last 18 months, there has been a marked shift
in how vendors value website advertising. They've come to realize that website ads tend to be
less effective than they once were. Given that I've never bought a single item by clicking on
an ad on a website, this conclusion seems correct in the small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is too much whimper and not enough bang for such a great, old property. I'll miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It points at the larger cosmic shame of advertising suitability, which is that there is very little
correlation between the quality or worthiness of a piece of content or property and its suitability
for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 22:27:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-12-28:2014/12/28/dr-dobbs-is-closing</guid><category>advertising</category></item><item><title>How You Know</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/12/16/how-you-know</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Reading this essay has modified my world model re: rereading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience

into the consumption of TV and online video and how that relates to ad effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is a topic that is close to us at YuMe, in fact, we've
&lt;a href="http://www.yume.com/PursuitofAttention/"&gt;done a bunch of research with IPG on it&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are mostly obvious – we all play with our mobile devices while we watch TV and
as a result pay less attention to the ads – but there are interesting and specific numerics. The
recommendations, however, are pretty depressing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run more impressions of the same ad (as high as 80% more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use audio cues in television ads to wrest our attention from our mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are logical, I guess, but are only going to make the problem worse. Nobody wants the TV to
start shouting at them. Repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

somewhat-beside-the-point legal action that French and German publishers are taking against
AdBlock Plus creator, Eyeo GmbH. He calls out three issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, a single private entity cannot decide what is acceptable or not for an entire sector.
Especially in such an opaque fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two, we must admit that Eyeo GmbH is filling a vacuum created by the incompetence and sloppiness
of the advertising community’s, namely creative agencies, media buyers and organizations that are
supposed to coordinate the whole ecosystem (such as the Internet Advertising Bureau.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three, the rise of ad blockers is the offspring of two major trends: a continual deflation of
digital ads economics, and the growing reliance on ad exchanges and Real Time Bidding, both
pushing prices further down.&lt;/p&gt;

things I've been wondering about is the ways in which advertising can be a net positive on the
world. I think there are three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertising can be useful for finding out about products and services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously. Perhaps the most acute example of this is Google's search ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertising can be entertaining.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not a particular ad is useful, it can be entertaining. There are many sub-genres of
this. Ads can be entertaining in the same way that content or art can be entertaining, i.e. they
can be funny, inspiring, educational, beautiful, titilating, arresting, etc. Super Bowl ads are
usually great examples of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertising can support great content and endeavors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to do a controlled experiment here and be certain that a world devoid of advertising
would have less great content in it than a world full of advertising. However, it does seem
likely. Regardless, the world we live in has substantial advertising infrastructure in
place, and, happily, that infrastructure is able to provide financial support to many great
journalists and artists and adventurers and athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not surprisingly, it seems that when most people are asked this question they immediately
think about public service ads such as anti-smoking or AIDs awareness campaigns. I agree, but I
happen to think that those are simply instances of 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 20:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-12-01:2014/12/01/valuable-advertising</guid><category>advertising</category></item><item><title>A New Start</title><link>http://thatjohnmartin.com/2014/11/20/a-new-start</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There is just so much great content being produced in blogs and podcasts lately that I need an outlet to respond
that scales better than email and Twitter and has less gifs than Tumblr. So here goes, again.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">John Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 20:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:thatjohnmartin.com,2014-11-20:2014/11/20/a-new-start</guid><category>the-blog</category></item></channel></rss>
